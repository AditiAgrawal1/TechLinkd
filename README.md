Project Overview

TechLinkd is a platform aimed at redefining how developers create, maintain, and showcase their professional identity. Unlike platforms that focus only on resumes or green dots of activity, TechLinkd aims to track and reflect real progress in a developer's journey — transparently, reliably, and dynamically.


Vision

To build the most authentic, activity-based developer profile platform that bridges the gap between talent and recruiters by offering a true reflection of skills, consistency, and growth mindset.


Problem Statement

Current platforms provide fragmented representations of a developer's progress. There's no single platform that:
Tracks all-round developer activity (learning, problem-solving, building, contributions)
Offers reliable proof of consistency and authenticity
Combines visibility with accountability

Target Audience

Final year college students
Freshers and early-career developers
Self-taught developers
Recruiters & hiring managers
Companies looking for hackathon-based hiring

Key Features - MVP

Profile Creation
Bio, skills, GitHub, LeetCode, Resume upload, etc.
Activity Calendar
Tracks actual engagement: code pushes, problem-solving, learning logs.
Learning Log
Manual entries or platform-verified logs (video tracking, task completions).
Skill Tags & Endorsements
Self-tagged + endorsed by peers or mentors.
Project Showcase
Pin featured personal, open-source, or internship projects.
Gamification (Basic)
Points, streaks, and leaderboard for engagement.
Searchable Profile Index
